# Arch/Manjaro Proton Guides

This repo contains guides for playing Steam games through Arch or Manjaro. These are mostly based on my expierence and may need some tweaking to work on your system. If you have an issue with any of these please let me know!

## These instructions apply for all guides here:

Ensure that your graphics drivers are the very latest, see https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Requirements for instructions.

Make sure you're enrolled in the Steam Client Beta to get the latest Proton versions.

From the Steam Client go to Steam > Settings > Steam Play, check "Enable Steam Play for supported titles" and "Enable Steam Play for all other titles" and under "Run other titles with:" make sure the newest Proton version is selected.
